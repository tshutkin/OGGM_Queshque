# OGGM_Queshque
Glacier Modeling in Queshque valley. My MA thesis work.
This repository will be populated with code concerning the following:
1] OGGM calibration - geodetic mass balance and GPR ice dynamics
2] Paleoglacier Equilibrium Experiments
3] Model validation, glacier projections, and spin-ups
